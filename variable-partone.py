#algebaric expression 
# 2x + 3y = 10 
# x and y is a variable. 10,2,3 is a literals (values)
#generalize the data using formula 
# I buy 10 apples. Each cost me 1.20. 
# what is the total amount to be paid?
# 10 times rm1.20    //  10 * 1.20 = rm12.00

# we need to generalize the real world problem with a formula

# price x quantity = price to be paid.
# technically we predict the price to be paid because the rm12 is not known to the user.
# q * p = y  <<<<<is a model lA!!!
# how to predict weather// predict house price // predict buyer in 
#  statistical prediction(not% correct ) vs mathematical prediction ( 100 %correct)
# machine is not learning . we teach them to learn. 
# we apply algebra formula for certain problem to be used in the future.
# model is technically a formula.

# literal etymology = the word letter meaning its letter by letter. 

# we see object as literal where we have a vocab for it. But we dont categorize it yet.
